# NHS Healthcare Access Analysis

This project analyzes the distribution of NHS healthcare facilities across the United Kingdom using geospatial and statistical techniques. The goal is to identify healthcare access inequality by comparing facility density with regional populations and highlighting underserved areas.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Map NHS facilities geographically  
- Analyze hospital distribution by type  
- Visualize healthcare access inequality  
- Identify cities with the highest concentration of facilities  
- Provide insights for public health planning and resource allocation

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

---

### 1️⃣ Cities with Most NHS Facilities
![Cities](images/Cities%20with%20Most%20NHS%20Facilities%20.png)

### 📝 Insight
This chart highlights the UK cities with the highest concentration of NHS healthcare facilities.  
It shows strong urban clustering, indicating that major cities have significantly better healthcare access.  
This helps identify regions with dense hospital availability for effective resource allocation.

---

### 2️⃣ Correlation Heatmap
![Correlation](images/Correlation%20heatmap.png)

### 📝 Insight
The correlation heatmap visualizes relationships between various dataset features.  
It reveals important patterns and associations across attributes related to healthcare distribution.  
This helps understand how multiple variables interact within NHS data.

---

### 3️⃣ Count of NHS Organisations by Type
![Count](images/Count%20of%20NHS%20Organiations%20by%20type.png)

### 📝 Insight
This visualization displays how NHS organisations are distributed across different categories.  
It highlights the dominance of general hospitals and community services within the system.  
This provides a clear view of NHS infrastructure structure and functional focus.

---

### 4️⃣ Healthcare Access Inequality (Population Per Facility)
![Inequality](images/Healthcare%20Access%20Inequality%20Population%20Per%20NHS%20Facility%20.png)

### 📝 Insight
This chart compares regional populations with the number of NHS facilities.  
Higher values indicate areas where each facility serves a larger population, suggesting possible healthcare inequality.  
These insights help identify underserved regions requiring additional NHS investment.

---

### 5️⃣ Hospital Type Distribution
![Hospital1](images/Hospital%20type%20distribution.png)

### 📝 Insight
This bar chart provides an overview of different hospital types across the NHS system.  
It shows the distribution of general, teaching, specialist, and community hospitals.  
The visualization helps assess the specialization mix and infrastructure diversity.

---

### 6️⃣ Hospital Type Distribution (Detailed)
![Hospital2](images/Hospital%20type%20distribution2.png)

### 📝 Insight
This extended chart offers a more detailed breakdown of hospital categories.  
It highlights less common and specialized healthcare facilities within the NHS network.  
Such granularity is useful for deeper policy analysis and regional healthcare planning.
