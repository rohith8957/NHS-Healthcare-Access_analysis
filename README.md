# NHS Healthcare Access Analysis

This project analyzes the distribution of NHS healthcare facilities across the United Kingdom using geospatial and statistical techniques. The goal is to identify healthcare access inequality by comparing facility density with regional populations and highlighting underserved areas.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Map NHS facilities geographically  
- Analyze hospital distribution by type  
- Visualize healthcare access inequality  
- Identify cities with the highest concentration of facilities  
- Provide insights for public health planning and resource allocation
